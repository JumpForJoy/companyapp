# companyapp
App for collecting JSON data and managing it.

## Installation
1. Checkout the project on your machine.
1. In the root of the project run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start` to start the server and check the app.
1. If you want to build the app, run `npm run build`.

## Remarks
* I haven't done (or haven't checked fully at least) a fully responsive design so, please, review on desktop.
* The services are faked by fetching the JSON files from a folder called 'FakeServer' in the public folder.
* When you click a nav element on the left, you get information accordingly on the right.
* You can scroll down and you'll still see the result.
* The 'info' buttons open the corresponding information.
* On the project window you can click 'edit' and then change the name and/or add/remove employees.
